## Create the virtual environment and install dependencies

1. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)

  conda create -p <Environment_Name> python==<python version> -y
  ```

2. Activate the Virtual Environment (Optional)

- Activate the virtual environment based on your operating system:
  ```
  conda activate <Environment_Name>
  ```

3. Install Dependencies`

- Run the following command to install project dependencies:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
